# Noun Cases in Uwrona

The Uwrona language has fourteen noun cases.

## Nominative

Subject of a verb.  The 'dictionary form' of a word.

    Juren Marnojna juredararemetat.
    (I figured out that Juren is going steady with Marno.)

The nominative form is the default form of a noun, and nouns thus do not decline into the nominative.

## Accusative

Direct object of a verb.  Recipient or beneficiary of an action.

    Marno moramoraju Buregan curetabenetan.
    (I heard that Marno said something to Burek.)

To decline into the accusative:

1. For nouns ending in a vowel, add final "-ju".
2. For nouns ending in a liquid, nasal, or palatal consonant, add final "-u."
3. For nouns ending in a weak consonant, change it to a strong consonant and add final "-u".
4. For nouns ending in a strong consonant, change it to a weak consonant and add final "-u".

## Dative

Indirect object of a verb.  Recipient or beneficiary of an action.  Expresses "to" or "toward" for an animate recipient.  (The allative case is used for inanimate recipients.)

The dative is also used as the object of a preposition for relationships not otherwise specified by a case marker.

    Marno curejureciju Buregan urkonemet.
    Marno is giving advice to Burek, or so I heard.
        (konen = to give; jureci = advice, aid, help)

To decline into the dative:

1. For nouns ending in a vowel, add final "-nan".
2. For nouns ending in a liquid, nasal, or palatal consonant, add final "-an."
3. For nouns ending in a weak consonant, change it to a strong consonant and add final "-an".
4. For nouns ending in a strong consonant, change it to a weak consonant and add final "-an".

## Ablative

"Out of" or "from", in the sense of motion away from an object or an action occurring as a consequence of another.  Expresses "after" and "out of."

    Marno huizum jajikemet.
    I saw Marno leave the house.
        (jiken = to leave)

To decline into the ablative:

1. For nouns ending in a vowel, add final "-mum".
2. For nouns ending in a liquid, nasal, or palatal consonant, add final "-um."
3. For nouns ending in a weak consonant, change it to a strong consonant and add final "-um".
4. For nouns ending in a strong consonant, change it to a weak consonant and add final "-um".

## Allative

"Into" or "toward", in the sense of one action occurring as a prerequsite to another or motion toward an object.  Expresses "before" and "into," and "to" or "toward" for an inanimate recipient.

    Huizum Marnoca ikeno, tut tucamo topanamemo potabareju havarenetan.
    Before leaving Marno's house, she put the laptop in her backpack.
        (iken = to go; topaname = backpack; potabare = laptop computer; havaren = to put)
    
In the above example, note that _tut_ "her" is doubly declined in _tucamo topanamemo_, being declined first into the genitive ("her.poss") and then into the allative.

To decline into the allative:

1. For nouns ending in a vowel, add final "-mo".
2. For nouns ending in a liquid, nasal, or palatal consonant, add final "-o."
3. For nouns ending in a weak consonant, change it to a strong consonant and add final "-o".
4. For nouns ending in a strong consonant, change it to a weak consonant and add final "-o".

## Adessive

"Near," in the sense of one object being near another.  Expresses "at", "near", "beside", and "next to."

When double-declined into the ablative, means "in front of;" when double-declined into the allative, means "behind;" when double-declined into the comitative, means "inside."

To decline into the adessive:

1. For nouns ending in a vowel, add final "-hex".
2. For nouns ending in a liquid, nasal, or palatal consonant, add final "-ex."
3. For nouns ending in a weak consonant, change it to a strong consonant and add final "-ex".
4. For nouns ending in a strong consonant, change it to a weak consonant and add final "-ex".

## Superessive

## Subessive

## Causative

"Because of," in the sense that one thing causes another.  Represents "by" in the sense of a thing being created by someone (the comitative case represents "by" in the sense of a tool used to create something).

    Burejna Marnoca gavrenoj, Juren tica huizo ikenetan.
    Because of Marno's conversation with Burek, Juren went to his house.

To decline into the causative:

1. For nouns ending in a vowel, add final "-noj".
2. For nouns ending in a consonant, remove the final consonant and add final "-noj".

## Genitive

Owner-owned relationship.  Describes the owner of an object or the originator of an action.  Also expresses "about" or "concerning."

    Xo, urs huis Marnoca emet xoj.
    (Yes, this is definitely _Marno's_ house.)

    Oje, urs huis Wiherca emet.  Marnoca emetapa.
    (No, this is William's house. It's not Marno's.)



## Comitative

Accompaniment.  Expresses "with" or "by means of."

    Juren Marnovame juredararemetat.
    (Juren is going steady with Marno, as I figured out.)

    Marno Buregame dararenatarasika?
    Didn't Marno used to go out with Burek?

## Reflexive

Indicates that a given noun is its own subject and object in a sentence.

    Tugupum Marnocimus keremet.
    Mirror.ABL Marno.REFL see.NPAST-PRES-IND.
    Marno sees herself in the mirror.
        (tugub = mirror from tugran = glass and gubur = shiny, reflective; keren = to see from ker = eye)

## Privative

The inverse of comitative; expresses "without".

## Imitative

Imitation.  Expresses "like" or "as".  Requires double-declension into another case.

    Marno Jurenameju gavremet.
    Marno.NOM Juren.IMI.ACC talk.NPAST-PRES-IND.
    Marno talks _like Juren_.

In the above, _Jurename_ (imitative declension of Juren) is double-declined into the accusative.

When combined with other cases, the imitative has these meanings:
    
- Imitative-accusative: "like X" as the direct object of a verb.
- Imitative-allative: "to someplace like X"
- Imitative-ablative: "from someplace like X"
- Imitative-adessive: "at/near someplace like X;" "beside someplace like X"
- Imitative-adessive-allative: "in front of someplace like X"
- Imitative-adessive-ablative: "behind someplace like X"
- Imitative-adessive-comitative: "in someplace like X"
- Imitative-dative: "to someone like X"
- Imitative-causative: "because of something like X"
- Imitative-genitive: "belonging to something like X;" "an X-like's Y"
- Imitative-comitative: "with something like X"
- Imitative-imitative: "something that is like something that is like X"; "with something vaguely like X"
- Imitative-reflexive: "something that is like itself"

In this way, the language permits up to four declensions of a single noun - a noun may be declined into the imitative-imitative-adessive-comitative case, viz. Cinazamevamehejna "in a place resembling a country like China => in a country sort of like China".

Less pathological would be something like:

    Woture icuca huizamehexum Bureca wuremet.
    Car.NOM me.GEN house.IMI.ALL.ABL Burek.GEN PRESUMPTIVE.copula.NPAST-PRES-IND.
    My car is possibly at someplace like in front of Burek's house.
    I don't know where my car is; maybe it is in front of Burek's house.

The imitative case can, as shown above, convey uncertainty - the speaker thinks their car might be in front of Burek's house in this specific example, but they are unsure - hence, someplace like in front of his house.

Frequency tables: self-explanatory.  Tweak these based on how the words look that you get back.

Phoneme classes:
    - H: High vowels
    - L: Low vowels
    - V: All vowels
    - S: "Strong" (voiced) consonants
    - W: "Weak" (voiceless) consonants
    - R: Liquid consonants (would include the uvular trill as well as the liquids if they were present)
    - P: Palatalizing consonants (as in the Slavic languages)
    - N: Nasals
    - C: All consonants aside from the palatalizing consonants
    - X: The counterpart of a given consonant, used for consonant "harmony."

Voicing rules: Concordance for converting voiced to voiceless and vice versa

Permissible syllables: strings describing syllable structure.

Lenition table: sound-specific rules for lenition.

Combining rules: rules for combining adjoining syllables.  Presented in the json file in order of precedence (higher = applied sooner)
    - Nasal velar prohibition: if a nasal velar would occur (ng, mg, nk, mk), the velar is deleted, leaving only the nasal.  (*Angra => Anra "English, Anglo-"; *Xong-Kong => Xon-Kon "Hong Kong")
    - Devoicing rule: successive syllables with voiced/voiceless consonants must alternate in voicing. (*papa => paba or bapa)
    - Palatalization rule: Nasal consonants always palatalize low vowels.
        (*ma => mja; *me => mje; *mo => mjo; *na => nja; *ne => nje; *no => njo)
    - Degemination: The same consonant may not occur twice in succession.
        - Degemination with elision: A vowel is added between the geminate consonants.
        - Degemination with elimination: The geminate consonants may be collapsed into one.
    - Lenition: When appearing between two vowels, consonants change to become more sonorous, in accordance with the lenition table.
    - Vowel contraction: The same vowel may not occur twice in succession.

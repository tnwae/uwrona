## Examples of the verb system

The language's verb system allows for considerable richness and economy of expression.

    Tut getikematakapa?  [1]
    "Did she not have to leave?"

    Tut wugetikematapa.  [2]
    "I think she didn't have to leave."

    Xov gavrenu dujuvame emetataka? [3]
    What.NOM word.ACC you.IMI copula.NPAST-CONT-IND-INTERR?
    What is your name?

    Gavrenu icivame Marno emetat. [4]
    Word.ACC me.IMI Marno copula.NPAST-CONT-IND.
    My name is Marno.

The language lacks a specific noun for "name," and so a person has "a word like themselves".

    Tut Rondramo ikenemetat. [5]
    She.NOM London.ALL go.NPAST-CONT
    She is on her way to London.
        (iken = to go)

    Xomre tut Rondramo ikemet. [6]
    Soon she.NOM London.ALL go.NPAST-IND-PERF
    She is going to London soon.    

    Juren Marnojna curedararemetat. [7]
    Juren.NOM Marno.COMI HEARSAY.go-steady.NPAST-CONT.
    I heard Juren is going steady with Marno.
        (dararen = to go steady; to be one's love partner)

    Urs huis Marnoca jajemet.  [8]
    This.NOM house.NOM Marno.GEN FIRSTHAND.copula.NPAST-PERF.
    As you can see, this is Marno's house.
        (en - the coupla)

    Aram huiru Marnoca ikeno, [9a]
    Before house.ABL Marno.GEN leave.ALL,
    Before leaving Marno's house,
    
    Raci tuca topanamemo tuca potabareju jahavarenetan. [9b]
    Lacy.NOM she.GEN backpack.ALL she.GEN laptop.ACC FIRSTHAND.put.PAST-PERF.
    I watched Lacy put her laptop in her backpack.
          (havaren = to put, to place; topaname = backpack; potabare = laptop computer)

Nouns may be turned into verbs ("verbified") by appending the copula "en."  This includes inflected nouns.  As an example:

    Parici "Paris"
        => Paricimo "from Paris" (declension into the ablative)
        => Paricimomen "to be from Paris; to be Parisian" (verbification)

Verbs may also be turned into nouns ("nounified") by removing the final "en."  Because specific verbs may require specific noun cases, the two are separately listed in the lexicon.

    Marno cicex huisemetat. [10]
    Marno.NOM here.ADE live.NPAST-CONT.
    Marno lives here.
        (huisen = to live at a place; to reside; object is adessive)

    Urs huizu Marnoca emet. [11]
    This.NOM house.ACC Marno.GEN copula.NPAST-PERF.
    This is Marno's house.
        (huis = house)

The root word of _daren_ (to love), _darar_ (romantic partner), _daramen_ (to date), _daraman_ (spouse),  _daramanen_ (to marry), and _darukoda_ (rose) is _dar_ "love."

    Juren dararu Marnoca emet. [12]
    Juren.NOM boyfriend.ACC Marno.GEN copula.NPAST-PERF.
    Juren is Marno's boyfriend.
        (darar = romantic partner; boyfriend; girlfriend)

    Juren Marnojna dararemetat. [13]
    Juren.NOM Marno.COMI go-steady.NPAST-CONT.
    Juren and Marno are dating.
        (dararen = the act of being one's darar)

    Juren daramanu Marnoca xiremetat. [14]
    Juren.NOM spouse.ACC Marno.GEN VOLITIONAL.copula.NPAST-IND-CONT.
    Juren wants to be Marno's husband.
        (daraman = spouse; husband; wife)

    Juren Marnonan tijna xidaramanekaren curegemanenetan.  [15]
    Juren.NOM Marno.DAT he.COMI VOLITIONAL.marry.COND-INF HEARSAY.ask.PAST-IND-PERF.
    I heard that Juren asked Marno if she wanted to marry him.
        (gemanen = to ask; daramanen = to marry, to be married)

In Sentence 15 above, the idea of "I heard that..." is related through the hearsay evidential cur(e)-.  The verb _gemanen_ requires that its object be in the dative (i.e., one asks a question _to_ someone).  THe verb _daramanen_ requires that its object be in the comitative (i.e., one marries _with_ someone else).  The internal clause (_Marnonan tijna xidaramanen_) self-embeds without modification.

Nationalities are expressed by declining a country name into the allative case and appending the copular _en_ - for example, _American_ translates as _Amerikamomen_.  Languages are identified by either their nation of origin or the people most broadly associated with them - e.g., _Arab-gavre_ "Arabic language," _Vranca-gavre_ "French language," _Anra-gavre_ "English language."  The noun _gavre_ means "speech," "language," or "words" based on context.  The verb _taben_ means "to talk" or "to speak" without a target.  (The verb _gavren_ means "to say," "to speak," or "to talk" _with_ a target.)

    Tut Vrancamometat. [16]
    She.NOM France.ALL.copula.NPAST-IND-CONT.
    She is French.

    Tut Vranca-gavreju tabematat. [17]
    She.NOM France-language.ACC speak.NPAST-POT-CONT.
    She can speak French.
        (taben = to speak; Vranca = France)

    Icu Amerikamometat. [18]
    I.NOM America.ALL.copula.NPAST-IND-CONT.
    I am American.
    
    Icu Anra-gavreju tabematat. [19]
    I.NOM England-language.ACC speak.NPAST-POT-CONT.
    I can speak English.

    Duj Wurdojccranemokara, [20a]
    You.NOM PRESUMPTIVE.Germany.ALL.copula.NPAST-COND-PERF,
    If you were German,

    duj Dojccran-gavreju tabematat. [20b]
    you.NOM Germany-language.ACC speak.NPAST-POT-CONT.
    you could speak German.
        (Dojccran = Germany)

The conditional can also be used, as in Sentence 21 below, to offer advice.

    Icu dujekara, [21a]
    Me.NOM you.copula.NPAST-COND-PERF,
    If I were you, 

    tudan xidararekarenu gemanekara. [21b]
    her.DAT VOLITIONAL.go-steady.COND-INF.ACC ask.NPAST-COND-PERF.
    I'd ask her out.
        (gemanen = to ask)

Note in Sentence 21b above and Sentence 22 below, the idea of asking someone on a date is related by adding the volitional mood marker to the verb _dararen_.  In both cases, the verb is treated like a noun and thus is declined into the accusative case since it is the direct object of the verb.

    Tudan xidararenu gemanetan!  [22]
    Her.DAT VOLITIONAL.go-steady.INF.ACC ask.PAST-IND-PERF!
    I asked her out!
    
    Ty tut "xo" meju gavrenetan!  [23]
    And she.NOM "yes" quote-particle.ACC say.PAST-IND-PERF!
    And she said yes!
        (gavren = to say)

Adjectives are also verbable.  An adjective that modifies a noun comes after it at all times.

    Woture icuca jamojemet.  [24]
    Car.NOM me.GEN red.NPAST-IND-PERF.
    My car is red.
        (woturen = car; jamojen = red)

    Oje, woture icuhex emet.  [25]
    Yes, car.NOM me.ADE copula.NPAST-IND-PERF.
    Yes, I have a car.  (= Yes, a car is at me.)

    Oje, urs woture icuju emet.  [26]
    Yes, this.NOM car.NOM I.GEN copula.NPAST-IND-PERF.
    Yes, this is my car.

The language lacks a word meaning "to have;" to express possession in this way, one uses the adessive case on the possessor and the copula.

Because nouns can be verbed, the language has a separate imitative verb aspect.

    Marno harehare reniJuremet. [28]
    Marno.NOM much IMITATIVE.Juren.NPAST-PERF
    Marno acts a lot like Juren.

    Juren reniAnren didaremet.  [29]
    Juren.NOM IMITATIVE.Britain.INF DIMINUTIVE.love.NPAST-IND-PERF.
    Juren likes to act British.
        (di- diminutive prefix; didaren = to like)

    Uc Cina-gavrevame wurenihasemet.  [30]
    That.NOM China-language.IMITATIVE PRESUMPTIVE.IMITATIVE.sound.NPAST-IND-PERF.
    I think that sounds like Chinese.
        (hasen = to make a sound, to sound; renihasen = to sound like.)

In sentence 30, observe that the item of comparison ("that") is in the nominative, whereas the thing it is being compared to (the Chinese language) is in the imitative case.  The "I think" relationship, where the speaker is expressing an opinion, is rendered via the presumptive aspect, while the imitative action (something sounding similar to spoken Chinese) is rendered via the imitative aspect.  The grammatical rule is that a verb in the imitative aspect requires an object in the imitative case.

The intent of the imitative aspect (and the imitative case of nouns) is to express one thing being like another, or to express imitation (one person acting like another, something sounding like something else, etc.).  If mere similarity is all that is desired (what would be considered a simile in English; "X is like Y"), then only the noun need be rendered in the imitative case.

    Dar __tukodawame__ emet. [31]
    Love.NOM flower.IMITATIVE copula.NPAST-IND-PERF.
    Love is like a flower.

    Darajna homemet, [32a]
    Partner.COM good.NPAST-IND-PERF,
    With a good partner,

    dar darukodavame zurenitukodemat.  [32b]
    love.NOM rose.IMITATIVE LEGEND.IMITATIVE.bloom.NPAST-POT-PERF.
    the legends say that love can bloom like a rose.

In sentence 32, legend being the source of the statement is indicated by the evidential marker zu(r)-.  Because _darukodavame_ "rose" is in the imitative case, _tukoden_ "bloom" must have the imitative aspect.

    Woture icuca huizamehexum Bureca wuremetat.  [33]
    Car.NOM me.GEN house.IMI.ALL.ABL Burek.GEN PRESUMPTIVE.copula.NPAST-PRES-CONT.
    My car is possibly at someplace like in front of Burek's house.
    I don't know where my car is, but I think it is in front of Burek's house.

Sentence 33 demonstrates a more idiomatic use of the imitative case, namely to denote uncertainty.  The use of the presumptive mood on _en_ (_wuremetat_) indicates uncertainty about the action - in this case, "might be" in contrast to "is."  The use of the triple declension of _huis_ - "in front of something like a house" - combined with the immediate use of a noun in the genitive case to indicate that house's owner indicates uncertainty about the place where the action occurs - "an (in front of Burek's house)-like place."  The subject of the sentence, _woture icuca_, simply refers to the thing whose location is uncertain - "my car."
